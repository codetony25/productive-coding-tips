- Filter your search by clicking the gear icon to only look in specific areas.
- Search by Regex, by whole words, or turn on case sensitivity.
- Search with wildcards(*) for example ```*Block.php or  Block.*```
- Search by each capital letter in file name.
- Search by typing in the path for example ```/path/to/file.js```
- Search file with and jump to line number when opened. For Example ```server.js:40```
- Search for structural blocks/templates with by finding an action and look for ```Search Structurally``` you can also replace a block of code with ```Replace Structurally```.

### Emmet (http://emmet.io/)

- Our IDE includes Emmet by default. It is a plugin that increases your code editing workflow.
- Includes HTML, CSS, and XSL fast on tab snippets!
- Go to the website and read the documentation, it is pretty worth it.
- Their cheatsheet is at (http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)

### Code Completion

- If you want to see Basic Code Completion suggestions you can press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>SPACE</kbd>
- It will show suggestions for variables, types, methods, expressions, and more.
- Most of the time, I use Smart Code Completion instead with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>SPACE</kbd>
- We also have Statement Completion it will add missing parentheses, brackets, braces, and other necessary formatting with <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> <kbd>CMD</kbd> <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
- You can also press enter if your code completion suggestion is first in the list to automatically insert.
- Hippie Completion (Cycles through keywords, class names, methods, or variables within the file) with <kbd>ALT</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd> don't know if anyone uses this, I just always type it in.

## Project Navigator

- Quickly go to your project window by typing in <kbd>CMD</kbd> <kbd>1</kbd> and go back to you code editor by pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd>.
- You can search for any files by just typing while you are in the project window.
- You can choose to show only your changed files.
- You can choose to show by `Structure` instead of by files. This is useful if you are in a huge file and just want to see seperated class names, methods, functions, and so on.
- Click the `target` for it to immediately point you to your current file opened in your code editor.
- Click the `collapse` to collapse all files and folders to root.
- One useful thing is the `Autoscroll from source` which automatically moves to the current file that you are editing in your code editor.
 
## Version Control

- You can quickly open up version control by pressing <kbd>CMD</kbd> <kbd>9</kbd>
- Quickly see version control operations with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd>
- Choose a way to update your project with <kbd>CMD</kbd> <kbd>T</kbd>
- Shows Git Log visually and you can select each commit to compare differences.
- You can use annotate to see who has changed something previously
- See all your local changes.
- You can create a changelist to make sure those files will not be commited.
- See Differences between local and previously committed files.
- When you get a merge conflict, we can fix easily by right clicking the file -> Git -> Fix Merge Conflict (The best feature in my opinion)

## Productivity Guide

- Since its built in, you can see your productivity guide by going to Help -> Productivity Guide
- Shows how much time you have saved using code completion has saved you.
- Shows you how many possible bugs that the IDE has saved you from.
- Shows all IDE features that are related to productivity and how many times you have used it.
- Shows information on how to use it.
